# Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning models

This repository contains ML models to detect intrusion in computer systems based on a handful of features like protocol type, number of data bytes from source to destination, number of failed login attempts etc.

Please refer the Jupyter Notebooks for detailed results.

Please refer the Assignment.pdf file for a detailed desciption of features being used to train these models.
